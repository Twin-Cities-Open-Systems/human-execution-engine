                          JSON Web Token (JWT)

Abstract

   JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing
   claims to be transferred between two parties.  The claims in a JWT
   are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON
   Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web
   Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally
   signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code
   (MAC) and/or encrypted.
